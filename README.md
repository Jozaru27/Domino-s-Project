# Domino's-Project
An HTML/CSS Project simulating a Domino's Pizza webpage.

This simple but dedicated project started as a deliverable task, up for evaluation in an HTML-related course. The experience gained from this collaborative experience has given me further interest into learning how to develop HTML pages more efficiently.

Several authors worked on this project:
